          <img class="imgperson" src="img/tamra.png" alt=""><p class="pperson">Wednesday, March 04 by Rob Harris</p>
          <img class="imghero" src="img/hero1.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="phero">Turmeric curcumin extract has been known for thousands of years as an anti-inflammatory and effective pain relief treatment. In contrast to a high-turmeric diet or traditional supplements, chronic pain sufferers can finally be relieved of pain using this <strong><a class="aorange" href="redirect.html"> revolutionary new treatment</a></strong> with vastly improved results. No prescription is required to experience this powerful yet safe formula that's now available to the public in <strong><a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">limited quantities</a></strong>.</p>
          <h2 class="txtlfnat">A Natural Solution for Drastically Improved Pain Relief</h2>
            <p class="txtlf"><img class="imginc" src="img/sport-doctor.jpg" alt="">If you've suffered from chronic pain, you know the limitations of over-the-counter remedies. Sure, traditional painkillers, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, show up in most medicine cabinets, but they can also cause serious damage to the liver and digestive tract. Prescription pain and inflammation medications can also come with a host of side effects. And let's be honest, sometimes they just don't seem to work.</p>

            <p class="txtlf"> Fortunately there's a powerful new chronic pain and inflammation solution that's immediately available to consumers with <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">no side effects</a>. Doctors are hailing this innovative product as a safer alternative to prescription anti-inflammatories and a far more effective option than traditional turmeric supplements. Multiple recent studies have found that this formula is, in fact, the <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">most effective form of turmeric curcumin</a> available today.</p>

            <p class="txtlf">It's quickly gaining traction among professional athletes who need to manage pain and inflammation on a daily basis. With no side effects and numerous benefits, including <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">improved digestion, liver support, cognition and cardio health</a>, it's the "Swiss Army Knife" supplement that's perfect for high-impact athletes. This groundbreaking new product is  <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">PuraThrive's Curcumin Gold</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="h2left">How It Works</h2>
            <p class="txttur">Turmeric curcumin is known for its natural anti-inflammatory properties, but it's also known for its poor absorption into the body, or reduced bioavailability. Most turmeric supplements, in fact, only offer about 3-4% of the compound's full healing power. What makes PuraThrive Curcumin Gold different is a scientifically developed formula that offers <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html"> 185x better bioavailability </a> when compared with other products.</p>
            <p class="txttur">To achieve this superior level of bioavailability, PuraThrive uses a <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">patented delivery system</a> that helps bring the maximum level of healing into the body. The curcumin compounds are encapsulated in healthy fats, called micelle liposomes, allowing them to travel safely through the digestive system for complete absorption. For even more anti-inflammatory power, the turmeric in Curcumin Gold is blended with a vegan DHA omega-3 fatty acid and ginger oil extract. This triple threat of healing compounds makes PuraThrive's Curcumin Gold an ideal choice for people seeking a single, <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">powerful multipurpose supplement</a>.</p>

Even though, I'm a little bit younger, I still deal with a lot of joint pain. And now, I can't live without this stuff. It really does make me feel good.

            <h2 class="h2left">Approved by Fitness and Nutrition Leaders</h2>
            <p class="txttur">Since becoming available to the public, PuraThrive's <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">Curcumin Gold</a> has also become a preferred product for professional trainers and nutritionists. One of the biggest supporters of this product is <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">Thomas DeLauer</a>, celebrity trainer, author and life coach. He has written several books about optimizing diets, muscle growth and recovery, including "The Superfood Detox Code," and "Top 10 Intermittent Fast Hacks." DeLauer is also a popular YouTuber, having gained thousands of fans by sharing his journey from being an overweight nine-to-fiver to adorning the cover of weightlifting magazines. For DeLauer, PuraThrive Curcumin Gold offers anti-inflammatory results that have had an <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">impact on his entire life</a>.</p>
            <p class="txttur">As a professional trainer and model, DeLauer puts in tons of hours at the gym and in his own words, "beats the heck" out of his body. In his review of the product, DeLauer explains that Curcumin Gold <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">reduces his inflammation fast</a> and leaves his joints feeling refreshed, which helps him endure workouts longer and keeps his mind sharp in his day-to-day life. He says, "I feel more clear when I'm at the office, I feel more clear when I'm filming, I feel more clear when I'm with my family, and it all flat out has to do with the reduction of inflammation in my body.</p>
            <p class="txttur">Thomas DeLauer is a high-performance athlete but in his opinion, it's also a <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">great option for seniors</a>. According to DeLauer, seniors need to take special care to mitigate any unnecessary damage to internal organs, so it's worth avoiding aspirin and ibuprofen. Instead, it's better to choose a natural alternative like Curcumin Gold, "so you can keep your organs healthy all while in the pursuit of feeling a little bit better in the joints when you're over the hill."</p>

            <h2 class="h2left">Proven Performance Backed by Clinical Trials</h2>
            <p class="txtpura">PuraThrive submitted Curcumin Gold for a <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">clinical trial</a> to test its patented micelle liposomal delivery system against other forms of turmeric curcumin supplements. Published in the Journal of Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, the study was a crossover trial that included 23 subjects. Each participant was given a 500mg dose of curcunimoids in varying forms, and blood samples were collected every 24 hours. The blood samples were tested for peak levels of curcuminoids and the relative levels of bioavailability were recorded.</p>
            <p class="txtresu">Results showed that curcumin lecithin had 4x absorption in the blood, turmeric oils had 7x absorption and curcumin in combination with black pepper had approximately 20x absorption. The micelle liposomal system, used in PuraThrive's Curcumin Gold, offered the <a class="aorange" href="redirect.html">greatest bioavailability by far</a>, with 185x levels of curcuminoids absorbed into the blood. Now that's a breakthrough performance.</p>

                        Privacy Policy for www.getpurathrive.com
                        The privacy of our visitors to www.getpurathrive.com is important to us.
                        At www.getpurathrive.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit www.getpurathrive.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.
                        Log Files
                        As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
                        Cookies and Web Beacons
                        We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.
                        We also use third party advertisements on www.getpurathrive.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
                        DoubleClick DART cookies
                        We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).

DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.

However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
                        Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
